For Alec - WIP.

## Developments
In chronological order:

 - Software to build example graphs/networks for algorithmic experimentation (better than Gephi - can make more than one edge ie. a Multigraph) [repo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/visualgraph-editor) [live](https://visualgraph-editor.stackblitz.io/)
 - [Thoughts on train back from Web3 (Oct)](https://gist.github.com/liamzebedee/c1bb4f79b67b3e7a39215b7ac3a80771)
 - [Economic Leverage & Personal Currency, DAO's, Climate Change vehicle (Oct)](https://slides.com/liamzebedee/retrust)
 - [Background - Part 1 (Oct)](https://medium.com/@liamzebedee/deriving-a-reliable-trust-protocol-that-scales-to-the-planet-pt-1-d994835cb008)
 - [Simulations of trust flow algorithms (Nov)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BITXYa-b8BOwmrKh0czSUzQVeOdTc0Uj)
 - [EBSL source (Nov)](https://gist.github.com/liamzebedee/1f5c56d656ceba808a2e99e78e9f6160)
 - [Protocol brainstorms (Dec)](https://hackmd.io/3UVGjqBhSDKsr85nYiiIsw), [Reputation as economic mechanism (Dec)](https://hackmd.io/3UVGjqBhSDKsr85nYiiIsw)

## Resources
 - “decentralized sybil resistant identity” at Devcon4. Read the [reputation jam tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/sinahab/status/1027640621110984704)
 - [Identity and reputation in Web3](https://sinahab.com/2018/09/identity-and-reputation-in-web-3/)
 - Sybil control using economic stake mechanisms in Bitcoin, from the inventor of Ethereum [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9szwi4/happy_whitepaper_day_xd/e8xxf4g/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=btc): ...the idea itself contained multiple fundamental innovations (chain-based consensus and, more importantly, the use of economic resources for the dual functions of incentivization and sybil control in distributed systems) that have transformed the field.
 - Subjective logic has problems with the communicativity of its operators. EBSL looks good ([Flow-based reputation with uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3319.pdf))
 - Relative vs. Absolute trust measures.

### Applications
 - Proof of personhood https://github.com/protocol/research/issues/11
 - A Universal Basic Income token, in which every unique individual who registers receives some amount of tokens.
 - A secure and anonymous method of tracking unique visitors or users
 - Electronic Voting
 - scalable personal currency https://www.joincircles.net/
 - citizen's economic leverage
