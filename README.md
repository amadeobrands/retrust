### Misc

 - Sybil control using economic stake mechanisms in Bitcoin, from the inventor of Ethereum [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9szwi4/happy_whitepaper_day_xd/e8xxf4g/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=btc): I truly do love the whitepaper! It's a great document and does an awesome job of presenting the core ideas that matter in nine easy to read pages, something that most academic papers absolutely fail at. And the idea itself contained multiple fundamental innovations (chain-based consensus and, more importantly, the use of economic resources for the dual functions of incentivization and sybil control in distributed systems) that have transformed the field.
